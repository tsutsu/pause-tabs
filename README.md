# Pause Tabs

Pause the tabs you're in the middle of reading instead of bookmarking them. Paused tabs will be added to the "Paused Tabs" folder on your Bookmarks Bar. When you reopen a Paused Tab, it will return to the scroll position where you left off, and the bookmark will be automatically removed.

Paused Tabs is perfect for saving your place in long reads, whether of very long web pages, or websites with many pages in sequence (e.g., webcomic archives.) You don't have to worry about removing your old bookmark and then adding a new one in a new position; just open a Paused Tab, and then pause it again when you've had enough for one session.
